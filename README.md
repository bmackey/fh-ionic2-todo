FeedHenry Template


*	What do I expect to get from a template?
*	What do I get from other templates that FH does not offer?
*	What features would I like to see in an 'out of the box' fh template?
*	From this, we took that a FH Quickstart template would ideally enable a user to generate not just a working application, but also be able to use the application as a reference/ 'how to do FH' / user guide for FH/RHMAP app development (the word best practices was also thrown around here). 

To achieve this, the template would need to check a number of boxes:
*	client app
*	cloud app
*	generic cloud calls
*	database collection/s
*	A simple CRUD (TODO/NOTES) app should be able to satisfy the above criteria and would be more than enough to give a FH/RHMAP user of any level a good starting point to get developing using FH/RHMAP. (detailed README.md's included also obviously) *	Including components of the relative client frameworks would also be a great advantage for the user (inputs, date select etc.). 

There are a number of features which could also be added to the templates which should be considered (or could be its' own template entirely):
*	sync framework
*	location services
*	image upload
*	push notifications
